Privacy Policy for NewSight

Welcome to NewSight. Your privacy is of paramount importance to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we do not collect from you, as well as our practices for handling the minimal data we do handle.

1. Introduction

NewSight is an application that allows users to rate physical appearances in a unique and engaging way. In line with our commitment to maintaining your privacy, this document details our approach to privacy and data handling.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

NewSight is designed to respect your privacy fully. To this end, we do not collect, store, or process any personal data from our users. This includes, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, location data, IP addresses, device IDs, or any other identifiers.

3. User Ratings

The core functionality of NewSight involves users rating physical appearances. These ratings are stored exclusively on the user's device and are not synced or stored on any of our servers. We do not have access to these ratings, and they remain the sole property of the user.

4. Data Security

Since we do not collect personal data, there are no data security measures in place on our servers. Users are advised to protect their device security to safeguard their ratings stored in the NewSight app.

5. Compliance with Privacy Laws

NewSight is committed to full compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations. Although we do not collect personal data, we have ensured that our practices are in line with global standards for data privacy and protection.

6. Children's Privacy

NewSight does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal data from a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information as soon as possible.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting notice within our application, and we will update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

8. Use of Non-Personal Data

While NewSight does not collect personal data, we may collect non-personal data about how the app is used (such as frequency of ratings or app usage patterns). This information is aggregated and used solely to improve the functionality and user experience of NewSight. It cannot be used to identify any individual user.

9. Data Retention Policy

As NewSight does not collect personal data, there is no data to retain or delete. All data related to ratings is stored locally on the user's device and can be deleted at any time by uninstalling the app.

10. Third-Party Services

NewSight may use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app (if any) should be provided here.

11. Your Consent

By using NewSight, you consent to our privacy policy. Your continued use of the app following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
